# RaBit

## About
RaBit is a platforming, puzzle, adventure game I have been working on using Game Maker Studio in between web development projects. The basic gameplay consists of moving around in a 2D space and stomping on monsters as well as toggling the game between a blue and a red state by pressing space, which will effect certain parts of the enviroment and some of the enemies as well.

While it is still a work in progress you can view videos of it using the links below!
