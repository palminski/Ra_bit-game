Recently we discovered that some sections of CAVE are not as solidly ingrained in the subjects consciousness as others.","We have developed an AUGMENT that makes these imperfections in the CAVE's geometry more apparent when STANDING CLOSE TO A WEAK WALL.", "Once one of these weak points has been discovered the AUGMENT bearer can actually WALK THROUGH IT!","If you would like to test the augment out yourself I have it stored on a computer in my office.\nRegards, Dr. Yoo"]
