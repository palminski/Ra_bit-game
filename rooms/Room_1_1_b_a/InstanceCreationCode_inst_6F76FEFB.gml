When I was asked to head up this project I honestly expected it to be harder seeing as we are dealing with atypical physics here.","I credit alot of that to my great ability to delegate. What can I say? I am a natural born leader, and the guys and gals in my group respect the hell out of me.","Once we have this augment up and running we will be able to take the fight to those pesky monsters. I have no idea how they keep getting into the facility, and they sure as shit aren't too friendly."];
